", Nurgiyatna, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D",Sistem Informasi Penjualan Sepeda Motor Bekas di Dealer Sinar Maju Motor Purwodadi,"Used motorcycles are still the choice for some consumers. The number of used motorcycle dealers shows that the business still exists. Along Diponegoro Street, Purwodadi, Grobogan, there are several used motorcycle dealers, one of which is Sinar Maju Motor. Unfortunately, the dealer has not fully utilized computerized technology in the process of buying and selling motorcycles. Although the Microsoft Excel application has been used, but the application was used only to record motorcycle details. Each motor that comes and sells was only recorded through a manual recording process in the company's ledger, so the risk of data input errors is shown. Therefore, the researcher concluded that there is a need for a sales information system that is expected to be able to minimize all forms of errors and to monitor sales traffic at Sinar Maju Motor dealer. This system is made only for administrator. Menu options that are carried in the information system are in the form of a homepage, motorcycle stock data, supplier data, transaction data that includes buying and selling, as well as reports for buying and selling. The information system was designed using the Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) programming language and MySQL database as well as through the Waterfall method. To test the system, the Black Box approach and User Acceptance Test were used. This system can manage motorcycle data, suppliers, purchases and sales of motorcycles with input motor data then processed into output reports on purchases, sales, and sales invoices. The results of testing this system showed that 90.2% of respondents received this system well and it can be concluded that this system has met the criteria in accordance with the objectives of software design.","Dealer, Motor bekas, Sistem informasi penjualan, User Acceptance Test,  Waterfall."

Therefore, the health of cows is very important for the milk village business. Late medical treatment can worsen the condition. Lack of knowledge of cattle breeders is one of the causes of disease in cows. A tool is needed that can predict what diseases a cow might suffer from and then treatment can be done to prevent the disease. This study designed an expert system to diagnose cow disease to solve problems in the milk village. This expert system is designed using the forward chaining method. The forward chaining method begins with analyzing symptoms based on facts into a reasoning and rules then producing a conclusion, namely the disease suffered by cattle. So that treatment can be done to prevent the disease before the condition gets worse. Android Studio software with the Java programming language and XML will be used to create this expert system based on android applications. Based on the results of the Black box test, the features in the system can function properly. Then, usability testing gets an average of 86.66%.

If that failure occurs, users cannot access the systems and have a risk of losing their data stored on the server. Therefore, a database server is required to work fast and has a high availability in its performance. The aim of this research is to build a high availability system where several database servers are connected so that if any failure occurs in one of them, another database server will act as a backup which is called a cluster database server.

Before making an application, a test is performed to find a time series model that is suitable for admission data. The tested models are the ARIMA model and the AutoRegression model.

The concept of self-ordering allows buyers to choose orders via desktop or mobile devices. The development of the system in this study allows orders that have been entered by buyers to be sent to the computer in the kitchen and payment invoices will be sent to the cashier's computer. The study took a case study at the Wulan Steak and Geprek Chicken Restaurant located in Mendungan, Kartasura where the restaurant still uses a manual ordering system. This study aims to build a food ordering system with a self-ordering concept in the Wulan Steak and Geprek Chicken restaurant that can facilitate the owner in serving buyers and facilitate the food ordering process.

Internet technology also provides ideas for creating and developing various technological innovations. Humans can make various kinds of devices as a tool in when doing various activities in daily life to be used appropriately, effectively and efficiently. One of the supporting devices is the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology which is part of information technology and can be applied to electronic devices. Internet of things (IoT) connecting the devices and tools to the internet network that can be controlled by websites and smart phone applications, controlling the tools and instruments by codes and algorithms structures. In this case the researcher want to create system that can helping human activity when they at house or when they leave the house. By using a Wi-Fi network as a central between users and the system. This research suggests a solution that can save human energy by controlling the device one by one. Using ESP32 as a microntroller of the system, allows this system to be controlled a many things at the same time and the addition of the Blynk Server database from the Blynk application allows this system to be accessed from a long distance where it functions to monitor the state of electronic device when the user is not in home.","Smarthome, ESP32, Blynk, Mikrokontroler, Arduino, Internet of Things."

During the Covid19 pandemic, it is difficult to find highly skilled construction workers nearby who are available since people do not have acquaintances or contacts of them. To address the problem, we propose to build a web-based information system that provide various information related to the construction workers such as hiring price, time availability and rating of workers’ skill. People who need their service can easily find the workers to hire them according to the workers skill. To develop the system we adopt Waterfall method, which consists of requirement analysis, design, development, testing, and maintenance. The system is built by using PHP Codeigniter framework as the programming language and MySQL as the database container. Based on the test results conducted by blackbox and SUS (System Usability Scale) methods, the blackbox testing method shows that the system has no errors, while from the sus test results obtain a percentage of 77% which indicates that the system is accepted in the community, and can be used in accordance with its functions.","Construction, Website, Waterfall, PHP."

Indonesia also experienced the same thing, various sectors began to experience a crisis, especially in economics. As a result, around 50% of UMKM actors closed their businesses, whereas in 2018 the UMKM sector contributed IDR 14,838.3 trillion to GDP, this indicates that this sector is very influential for the country's economy, even with the existence of UMKM, job opportunities are getting wider. The government seeks to restore the stability of the UMKM economy, by providing direct cash assistance and also providing electricity tax relief for UMKM actors. In addition, there is a need for an UMKM mapping information system that aims as a promotional media for UMKM that are returning to life so that they are immediately known again by the public, especially in the city of Solo. This information system was developed using the waterfall method, which resulted in an android-based geographic information system called the PILUS application. This application has a main feature that displays a map of the location of UMKM in the city of Solo, and UMKM actors can also add their store to the PILUS application.
